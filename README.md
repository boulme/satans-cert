# SatAns-Cert (Certifying Answers of Boolean SAT-Solvers)

We provide an [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/) wrapper certified in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) to check answers of state-of-the-art SAT-solvers.
On UNSAT answers, our wrapper checks lrat certificates generated by [drat-trim](https://github.com/marijnheule/drat-trim).

The design of our certified checker exploits a parametricity property of ML polymorphic types in order to keep the Coq code as lightweight as possible.
See details in our [slides from the Coq workshop 2018](https://coqworkshop2018.inria.fr/files/2018/07/coq2018_talk_boulme.pdf).
This technique is provided by our [Impure](https://github.com/boulme/satans-cert/tree/master/coq_src/Impure) library, itself inspired from the [Verified Polyhedra Library](https://github.com/VERIMAG-Polyhedra/VPL). Actually, we plan to put this Impure library in a separate repository, but this would currently rather inconvenient because of the lack of a "Separate Extraction" in Coq, compatible with OCaml separate compilation, see feature wish [8042](https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/8042).

This example demonstrates the "certification for free" of a generic memoizing fixpoint operator, ie by using only its polymorphic ML type + a bit of defensive checks.
