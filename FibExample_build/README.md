# Building FibExample

This repository mainly contains a `Makefile` in order to extract/compile/run [FibExample.v](https://github.com/boulme/satans-cert/blob/master/coq_src/Impure/FibExample.v).
Just type `make`.

NB: the execution ends on an expected failure (an incorrect fixpoint computation is detected by the certified defensive code).
See [FibExample.v](https://github.com/boulme/satans-cert/blob/master/coq_src/Impure/FibExample.v) for details.
